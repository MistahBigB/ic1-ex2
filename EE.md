My name is Brandon Bieschke, and I'm a bridge student to a Master's degree in Embedded Engineering.
I programmed extensively in JavaScript during the pandemic, until I had an opportunity to play with an STM board.
After 3 days, I had learned enough C (using codeblocks) to write commands with delays and interrupts to use the button
to cause lights to blink in a desired sequence, and I was hooked. I immediately enrolled in PSU's bridge program
and here I am.
